    <h1 class="j-1">javascript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game
        development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with
        only HTML and CSS.Many browsers use JavaScript as a scripting language for doing dynamic things on the web. Any
        time you see a click-to-show dropdown menu, extra content added to a page, and dynamically changing element
        colors on a page, to name a few features, you're seeing the effects of JavaScript.</p>
    <h2 class="j-3">applications of javascript</h2>
    <p>As mentioned before, Javascript is one of the most widely used programming languages (Front-end as well as
        Back-end). It has it's presence in almost every area of software development. I'm going to list few of them
        here:</p>
    <h3 class="j-4">Client side validation</h3>
    <p>This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server and Javascript plays an
        important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.</p>
    <h3 class="j-4">Manipulating HTML Pages </h3>
    <p>Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily
        using javascript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.
    </p>
    <h3 class="j-4">User Notifications</h3>
    <p> You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to give different types of notifications to your
        website visitors.</p>
    <h3 class="j-4">Back-end Data Loading </h3> 
    <p> Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end data while you are doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.</p>   
    <h2 class="j-3">Comments in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>Just like HTML, sometimes we may want to put a note beside our code which does not need to be executed.

        We can do this in JavaScript in two ways:
        
        with single-line comments, like this: // a single line comment
        or with multi-line comments, like this:
        /*
        a multi
        line comment
        */</p>
<br/>
<p>It is worked as JavaScript is either embedded into a web page or else it's included in a .js file. JavaScript is also a “client-side” language (rather than a “server-side” language), which is a fancy way of saying that it gets downloaded to site visitors computers, then processed.</p>
