    <h1 class="c-1">css</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language that is used to illustrate the look, style, and format of a document
        written in any markup language. In simple words, it is used to style and organize the layout of Web pages. CSS3
        is the latest version of an earlier CSS version, CSS2.

        A significant change in CSS3 in comparison to CSS2 is the introduction of modules. The benefit of this
        functionality is that it allows the specification to be finalized and accept faster, as segments are finalized
        and accepted in portions. Also, this allows the browser to support segments of the specification.</p>
        <p><b>Some of the key modules of CSS3 are:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Box model</li>
            <li>Image values and replaced content</li>
            <li>Text effects</li>
            <li>Selectors</li>
            <li>Backgrounds and borders</li>
            <li>Animations</li>
            <li>User interface (UI)</li>
            <li>Multiple column layouts</li>
            <li>2D/3D transformations</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="c-2">features of css</h1>
    <h2 class="c-3">selectors</h2>
    <p>Selectors allow the designer to select on more precise levels of the web page. They are structural pseudo-classes
        that perform partial matches to help match attribute and attribute values. New selectors target a pseudo-class
        to style the elements targeted in the URL. Selectors also include a checked pseudo-class to style checked
        elements such as checkboxes and radio buttons.</p>
        <h2 class="c-3">text effects & layouts</h2>
        <p>With CSS3, we can change the justification of text, whitespace adjustment of the document, and style the hyphenation of words.</p>
<h2 class="c-3"> Paged Media and Generated Content</h2>
<p>CSS 3 has additional choices in Paged Media, such as page numbers and running headers and footers. There are additional properties for printing Generated Content as well, like properties for cross-references and footnotes.</p>
<h1 class="c-4">advantages of css</h1> 
<p>CSS3 provides a consistent and precise positioning of navigable elements.
    It is easy to customize a web page as it can be done by merely altering a modular file.
    Graphics are easier in CSS3, thus making it easy to make the site appealing.
    It permits online videos to be seen without using third-party plug-ins.
    CSS3 is economical, time-saving, and most browsers support it.</p>
