    <p>HTML is a markup language, so it uses simple tags to markup and format the content. These tags are enclosed in
        angular brackets like html almost all the tags have their closing tags also. The html tag informs the
        browser that a HTML document has been started similarly

</html> tells the end of HTML document. All the things or code written inside these two tags are represented sent to the
browser. The browsers then display the content wrapped inside the body tag.HTML defines the format of how the web
elements should be displayed.To see your content, you need to save your file with. html or.htm extension and then
simply run it by choosing the option to open with any browse.HTML is one of the best options to develop a webpage or
website for a small or growing business that does not want to invest more in purchasing software or its license and does
not require any advanced programming for their websites.</p>

    make changes in it if required as there is not a lot more to understand in it. Moreover, it does not throw any error
    or create any problem like other programming languages if the developer forgets to close the tags or make some
    mistakes in code.</p>
